"What is your body made of? Your first thought might be that it is made up of different organs—such as your heart, lungs, and stomach—that work together to keep your body going. Or you might zoom in a level and say that your body is made up of many different types of cells. However, at the most basic level, your body—and, in fact, all of life, as well as the nonliving world—is made up of atoms, often organized into larger structures called molecules. Atoms and molecules follow the rules of chemistry and physics, even when they're part of a complex, living, breathing being. If you learned in chemistry that some atoms tend to gain or lose electrons or form bonds with each other, those facts remain true even when the atoms or molecules are part of a living thing. In fact, simple interactions between atoms—played out many times and in many different combinations, in a single cell or a larger organism—are what make life possible. One could argue that everything you are, including your consciousness, is the byproduct of chemical and electrical interactions between a very, very large number of nonliving atoms!
So as an incredibly complex being made up of roughly 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms, you'll probably want to know some basic chemistry as you begin to explore the world of biology, and the world in general.",Introduction
"The term matter refers to anything that occupies space and has mass—in other words, the “stuff” that the universe is made of. All matter is made up of substances called elements, which have specific chemical and physical properties and cannot be broken down into other substances through ordinary chemical reactions. Gold, for instance, is an element, and so is carbon. There are 118 elements, but only 92 occur naturally. The remaining elements have only been made in laboratories and are unstable. Each element is designated by its chemical symbol, which is a single capital letter or, when the first letter is already “taken” by another element, a combination of two letters. Some elements follow the English term for the element, such as C for carbon and Ca for calcium. Other elements’ chemical symbols come from their Latin names; for example, the symbol for sodium is Na, which is a short form of natrium, the Latin word for sodium. The four elements common to all living organisms are oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N), which together make up about 96% of the human body. In the nonliving world, elements are found in different proportions, and some elements common to living organisms are relatively rare on the earth as a whole. All elements and the chemical reactions between them obey the same chemical and physical laws, regardless of whether they are a part of the living or nonliving world.",Matter and elements
"An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element. For example, a gold coin is simply a very large number of gold atoms molded into the shape of a coin, with small amounts of other, contaminating elements. Gold atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of gold. A gold atom gets its properties from the tiny subatomic particles it's made up of. An atom consists of two regions. The first is the tiny atomic nucleus, which is in the center of the atom and contains positively charged particles called protons and neutral, uncharged, particles called neutrons. The second, much larger, region of the atom is a “cloud” of electrons, negatively charged particles that orbit around the nucleus. The attraction between the positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons holds the atom together. Most atoms contain all three of these types of subatomic particles—protons, electrons, and neutrons. Hydrogen (H) is an exception because it typically has one proton and one electron, but no neutrons. The number of protons in the nucleus determines which element an atom is, while the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus determines which kind of reactions the atom will undergo. The three types of subatomic particles are illustrated below for an atom of helium—which, by definition, contains two protons. Protons and neutrons do not have the same charge, but they do have approximately the same mass, about 1.67 × 10^{-24}1.67×10?24 grams. Since grams are not a very convenient unit for measuring masses that tiny, scientists chose to define an alternative measure, the dalton or atomic mass unit (amu). A single neutron or proton has a weight very close to 1 amu. Electrons are much smaller in mass than protons, only about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit, so they do not contribute much to an element’s overall atomic mass. On the other hand, electrons do greatly affect an atom’s charge, as each electron has a negative charge equal to the positive charge of a proton. In uncharged, neutral atoms, the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus. The positive and negative charges cancel out, leading to an atom with no net charge. Protons, neutrons, and electrons are very small, and most of the volume of an atom—greater than 99 percent—is actually empty space. With all this empty space, you might ask why so-called solid objects don’t just pass through one another. The answer is that the negatively charged electron clouds of the atoms will repel each other if they get too close together, resulting in our perception of solidity.",The structure of the atom
"It may seem obvious now that we, and other living things, are made up of cells. Prior to the 1600s, however, it wasn’t obvious at all, for the simple reason that no one had ever seen a cell up close and personal. To distinguish individual cells in a piece of tissue or individual bacteria in a sample of liquid required the development of relatively high-powered microscopes, instruments used for magnifying objects otherwise too small to be seen. The first person to observe cells as microscopic structures was the British scientist Robert Hooke. In fact, he was the person who gave cells their name. In his book Micrographia, he used the term cell to refer to the box-like structures he saw when he looked at dead cork tissue through a simple microscope. He chose cell as the name because these boxes reminded him of the cells of a monastery, the simple rooms in which monks slept. The cells that Hooke observed, however, were in dead tissue, and were in fact cell walls left behind after the death of the real cells. The first person to observe living, moving cells was Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch shopkeeper and crafter of lenses. In the 1670s, inspired by Hooke’s book, he began to build his own, more powerful microscopes. With these, he was able to observe living single-celled organisms—such as bacteria—and sperm cells, which he collectively called animalcules. Despite the discovery that cells existed, it took quite some time for scientists to realize that they weren’t just an odd fringe case, but rather, the essential building blocks of all plants, animals, and other living things. In fact, it wasn’t until the 1830s that botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann put forth a revolutionary idea: all the different parts of plants and animals are made up of cells, and that cells can be produced from other cells.

"From the work of biochemist Phoebus Levene and others, scientists in Watson and Crick's time knew that DNA was composed of subunits called nucleotides. A nucleotide is made up of a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) or cytosine (C). C and T bases, which have just one ring, are called pyrimidines, while A and G bases, which have two rings, are called purines. DNA nucleotides assemble in chains linked by covalent bonds, which form between the deoxyribose sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate group of the next. This arrangement makes an alternating chain of deoxyribose sugar and phosphate groups in the DNA polymer, a structure known as the sugar-phosphate backbone. One other key piece of information related to the structure of DNA came from Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff. Chargaff analyzed the DNA of different species, determining its composition of A, T, C, and G bases. He made several key observations: 1. A, T, C, and G were not found in equal quantities (as some models at the time would have predicted). 2. The amounts of the bases varied among species, but not between individuals of the same species. 3. The amount of A always equalled the amount of T, and the amount of C always equalled the amount of G (A = T and G = C). These findings, called Chargaff's rules, turned out to be crucial to Watson and Crick's model of the DNA double helix.",The components of DNA
