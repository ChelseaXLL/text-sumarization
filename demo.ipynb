Or you might zoom in a level and say that your body is made up of many different types of cells. However, at the most basic level, your bodyand, in fact, all of life, as well as the nonliving worldis made up of atoms, often organized into larger structures called molecules. Atoms and molecules follow the rules of chemistry and physics, even when they're part of a complex, living, breathing being. If you learned in chemistry that some atoms tend to gain or lose electrons or form bonds with each other, those facts remain true even when the atoms or molecules are part of a living thing. In fact, simple interactions between atomsplayed out many times and in many different combinations, in a single cell or a larger organismare what make life possible. One could argue that everything you are, including your consciousness, is the byproduct of chemical and electrical interactions between a very, very large number of nonliving atoms! So as an incredibly complex being made up of roughly 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms, you'll probably want to know some basic chemistry as you begin to explore the world of biology, and the world in general.\",\n",
       " 'The term matter refers to anything that occupies space and has massin other words, the stuff that the universe is made of. All matter is made up of substances called elements, which have specific chemical and physical properties and cannot be broken down into other substances through ordinary chemical reactions. Gold, for instance, is an element, and so is carbon. There are 118 elements, but only 92 occur naturally. The remaining elements have only been made in laboratories and are unstable. Each element is designated by its chemical symbol, which is a single capital letter or, when the first letter is already taken by another element, a combination of two letters. Some elements follow the English term for the element, such as C for carbon and Ca for calcium. Other elements chemical symbols come from their Latin names; for example, the symbol for sodium is Na, which is a short form of natrium, the Latin word for sodium. The four elements common to all living organisms are oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N), which together make up about 96% of the human body. In the nonliving world, elements are found in different proportions, and some elements common to living organisms are relatively rare on the earth as a whole. All elements and the chemical reactions between them obey the same chemical and physical laws, regardless of whether they are a part of the living or nonliving world.',\n",
       " \"An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element. For example, a gold coin is simply a very large number of gold atoms molded into the shape of a coin, with small amounts of other, contaminating elements. Gold atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of gold. A gold atom gets its properties from the tiny subatomic particles it's made up of. An atom consists of two regions. The first is the tiny atomic nucleus, which is in the center of the atom and contains positively charged particles called protons and neutral, uncharged, particles called neutrons. The second, much larger, region of the atom is a cloud of electrons, negatively charged particles that orbit around the nucleus. The attraction between the positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons holds the atom together. Most atoms contain all three of these types of subatomic particlesprotons, electrons, and neutrons. Hydrogen (H) is an exception because it typically has one proton and one electron, but no neutrons. The number of protons in the nucleus determines which element an atom is, while the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus determines which kind of reactions the atom will undergo. The three types of subatomic particles are illustrated below for an atom of heliumwhich, by definition, contains two protons. Protons and neutrons do not have the same charge, but they do have approximately the same mass, about 1.67  10^{-24}1.6710?24 grams. Since grams are not a very convenient unit for measuring masses that tiny, scientists chose to define an alternative measure, the dalton or atomic mass unit (amu). A single neutron or proton has a weight very close to 1 amu. Electrons are much smaller in mass than protons, only about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit, so they do not contribute much to an elements overall atomic mass. On the other hand, electrons do greatly affect an atoms charge, as each electron has a negative charge equal to the positive charge of a proton. In uncharged, neutral atoms, the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus. The positive and negative charges cancel out, leading to an atom with no net charge. Protons, neutrons, and electrons are very small, and most of the volume of an atomgreater than 99 percentis actually empty space. With all this empty space, you might ask why so-called solid objects dont just pass through one another. The answer is that the negatively charged electron clouds of the atoms will repel each other if they get too close together, resulting in our perception of solidity.\",\n",
       " 'It may seem obvious now that we, and other living things, are made up of cells. Prior to the 1600s, however, it wasnt obvious at all, for the simple reason that no one had ever seen a cell up close and personal. To distinguish individual cells in a piece of tissue or individual bacteria in a sample of liquid required the development of relatively high-powered microscopes, instruments used for magnifying objects otherwise too small to be seen. The first person to observe cells as microscopic structures was the British scientist Robert Hooke. In fact, he was the person who gave cells their name. In his book Micrographia, he used the term cell to refer to the box-like structures he saw when he looked at dead cork tissue through a simple microscope. He chose cell as the name because these boxes reminded him of the cells of a monastery, the simple rooms in which monks slept. The cells that Hooke observed, however, were in dead tissue, and were in fact cell walls left behind after the death of the real cells. The first person to observe living, moving cells was Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch shopkeeper and crafter of lenses. In the 1670s, inspired by Hookes book, he began to build his own, more powerful microscopes. With these, he was able to observe living single-celled organismssuch as bacteriaand sperm cells, which he collectively called animalcules. Despite the discovery that cells existed, it took quite some time for scientists to realize that they werent just an odd fringe case, but rather, the essential building blocks of all plants, animals, and other living things. In fact, it wasnt until the 1830s that botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann put forth a revolutionary idea: all the different parts of plants and animals are made up of cells, and that cells can be produced from other cells.

       " \"From the work of biochemist Phoebus Levene and others, scientists in Watson and Crick's time knew that DNA was composed of subunits called nucleotides. A nucleotide is made up of a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) or cytosine (C). C and T bases, which have just one ring, are called pyrimidines, while A and G bases, which have two rings, are called purines. DNA nucleotides assemble in chains linked by covalent bonds, which form between the deoxyribose sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate group of the next. This arrangement makes an alternating chain of deoxyribose sugar and phosphate groups in the DNA polymer, a structure known as the sugar-phosphate backbone. One other key piece of information related to the structure of DNA came from Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff. Chargaff analyzed the DNA of different species, determining its composition of A, T, C, and G bases. He made several key observations: 1. A, T, C, and G were not found in equal quantities (as some models at the time would have predicted). 2. The amounts of the bases varied among species, but not between individuals of the same species. 3. The amount of A always equalled the amount of T, and the amount of C always equalled the amount of G (A = T and G = C). These findings, called Chargaff's rules, turned out to be crucial to Watson and Crick's model of the DNA double helix.\"]"

       "['The first misstep of the Kennedy presidency, an ill-conceived 1961 CIA mission against Cuba, also had its roots in the Eisenhower administration. The CIA had been secretly planning an invasion to oust Fidel Castro. Overriding the doubts of key advisers, Kennedy approved this Eisenhower-era plan. On April 17, 1961, however, when U.S.-trained forces mainly anticommunist Cuban exiles) landed at the Bahia de Cochinas (Bay of Pigs) on the southern coast of Cuba, the expected popular uprising against Castro failed to materialize. Instead, forces loyal to the Cuban revolution quickly surrounded and captured members of the mission. Kennedy rejected any additional steps, including the air strikes that the Cuban exiles had expected, and initially denied any U.S. involvement in this Bay of Pigs invasion. The CIAs role quickly became public knowledge, however, and anti-U.S. sentiment swept across Latin America. Castro tightened his grip over Cuban life and strengthened his ties to the Soviet Union. Kennedy responded by calling the Bay of Pigs invasion a mistakeand by devising a new, covert program called Operation Mongoose. It abandoned the idea of an invasion in favor of destabilizing Cubas economy and, in concert with organized crime figures, trying to assassinate the Cuban leader. Tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union increased as well. In June 1961, Nikita Khrushchev and Kennedy met in Vienna, Austria, where the Soviets proposed ending the Western presence in Berlin and reuniting the city as part of East Germany. Kennedy refused to abandon West Berlin, but in August 1961 the communist regime began to erect a barbed wire fence and then a concrete barrier to separate East from West Berlin. This Berlin Wall became a symbol of communist repression. Kennedys assertion in a 1963 speech, Ich bin ein Berliner (I am a Berliner), delivered in front of the wall to a cheering crowd of West Berliners, provided a memorable image of JFKs presidency. Superpower confrontation, however, had already escalated to a potentially lethal level during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. The Soviet Union, responding to pleas from Castro, sent sophisticated armaments to Cuba. After U-2 spy planes revealed missile-launching sites in Cuba, the Kennedy administration declared it would never allow the Soviet Union to place nuclear warheads so close to U.S. soil. It demanded that the Soviets dismantle the missile silos and turn back supply ships heading for Cuba. After tense strategizing sessions with his top advisers, Kennedy rejected a military strike against Cuba, fearing it might lead to war with the Soviet Union. Instead, he ordered the navy to quarantine Cuba. The Strategic Air Command went on full alert for a possible nuclear con flict. Both sides also began frantic, secret diplomatic maneuvers to forestall such a catastrophe. The showdown ended after 13 anxious days. On October 28, 1962, Khrushchev ordered the Soviet missiles in Cuba dismantled and the supply ships brought home; Kennedy promised not to invade Cuba and secretly assured Khrushchev that he would complete a previously planned withdrawal of U.S. mis siles from Turkey. When Soviet archives were opened in the mid-1990s, people learned that the Cuban Missile Crisis had been even more dangerous than earlier imagined. Unknown to the Kennedy administration in 1962, the Soviets had already placed tactical nuclear weapons, which could have reached U.S. targets, inside Cuba. Some historical evidence suggests Castro favored atomic conflict over diplomatic concessions. The Cuban Missile Crisis underscored the peril of nuclear conflict and made the two superpowers more cautious. To prevent a future confrontation or an accident, they established a direct telephone hot-line between Moscow and Washington, D.C.',\n",
       " 'The politics of anticommunism came to affect the U.S. labor movement. After the end of the Second World War, many workers struck for increased wages and benefits and for a greater voice in workplace routines and production decisions. Strikes brought both the auto and the electronics industries to a standstill. After President Truman threatened to seize mines and railroads that had been shut down by work stoppages and to order strikers back to work, labor militancy began to subside. In 1947, a Republican-controlled Congress tapped anticommunist sentiment to help pass the Labor-Management Relations Act, popularly known as the Taft Hartley Act. The law negated gains made by organized labor during the 1930s. It limited a unions power to conduct boycotts, to compel employers to accept closed shops in which only union members could be hired, and to continue a strike that the president judged harmful to national security. In addition, the mea sure required union officials to pledge that they did not belong to the Communist Party or any other subversive organization. A union that refused to comply was denied protections under national labor laws. Congress overrode Trumans veto of Taft-Hartley, and by the end of his presidency a loyalty-security check had been conducted on about 20 percent of the U.S. workforce, more than 13 million people. The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) expelled 13 unionsa full third of its membershipas anticommunism also influenced internal labor politics. Many workers found that their political commitments could put their own jobs at risk. Anticommunists scrutinized workers in the entertainment indus try with special zeal. In 1947, the House Un-American Activi ties Committee (HUAC) opened hearings into communist influences in Hollywood. Basking in the glare of newsreel cam eras, members of this committee seized on the refusal of ten screenwriters, producers, and directorsall current or former members of the American Communist Partyto testify about political allegiances within the film community. The Hollywood Ten claimed that the First Amendment barred HUAC from scrutinizing their political activ ities. The federal courts upheld HUACs investigative powers, however, and the Holly wood Ten eventually went to prison for contempt of Congress. Hollywood studios as well as radio and television networks enforced their own internal blacklists of workers, allegedly subversives, whom they agreed not to hire. Blacklists affected not only prominent performers but many anonymous labor union members who worked behind the scenes in technical and support positions. Many entertainment workers were unable to find jobs unless they agreed to become friendly witnesses before HUAC or other investigative committees and to provide the names of people they had seen at some communist meeting in the past. Some of those called to testify, such as the screenwriter Lillian Hellman, refused to answer any questions. Others, such as the movie director Elia Kazan and the writer Budd Schulberg, cooperated. Decisions over whether or not to name names would divide people in the entertainment industry and the labor union movement for decades. The search for subversives created anticommunist celebrities. Ronald Reagan, presi dent of the Screen Actors Guild and a secret informant for the FBI (identified as T-10), testified about communist influence in Hollywood. Richard Nixon, an obscure member of Congress from California, began his political ascent in 1948 when Whittaker Cham bers, a journalist formerly active in communist circles, came before HUAC. Chambers charged Alger Hiss, a prominent Democrat, with having been a party member and with passing classified information to Soviet agents during the late 1930s. The HissChambersNixon affair still sparks controversy. Legal considerations barred an indictment of Hiss for espionage, but the government charged him with per jury for allegedly lying to Congress. Ultimately convicted on two counts, Hiss spent nearly four years in prison. To Nixon and his supporters, the case of Alger Hiss, who had advised Franklin Roosevelt during the Yalta Conference, demonstrated how deeply rooted communist subversion had become. To his supporters, Hiss appeared the victim of a frame-up. In the mid-1990s, newly declassified documents revived the Hiss contro versy. A few scholars continued to defend Hiss. The vast majority, however, concluded that Hiss (along with several other high-ranking government officials) had likely passed information to the Soviets during the 1930s and 1940s. Historians continue to differ, however, over the precise nature of this material and its value to Moscow. Meanwhile, the Truman administration pursued its own anticommunist course at home. It dismissed hundreds of federal employees under its loyalty program. Trumans attorney general, Tom Clark, secretly authorized J. Edgar Hoover, head of the FBI, to compile a list of alleged subversives the government could detain during any national emergency without any legal hearing. Fear that subversives might immigrate to the United States helped shape several provisions of the McCarran-Walter Act. Also known as the Immigration and Nation ality Act of 1952, this law authorized denial of immigrant status to anyone who might compromise national security by bringing dangerous ideas into the country. It also allowed the deportation of immigrants, even naturalized citizens, who belonged to organizations on the Attorney Generals List. Calling these measures un American, Truman rejected McCarran-Walter, but Congress overrode his veto. Hoovers FBI also undertook an extensive campaign of surveillance. It compiled confidential dossiers on artists and intellectuals suspected of radical views. Some of its targets, including the writers Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck, had no links to the Communist Party. The FBI often singled out prominent African Americans, including civil rights activist Bayard Rustin, Richard Wright (author of the acclaimed novel Native Son), and W. E. B. Du Bois (a celebrated African American historian). Paul Robeson (a well-known entertainer-activist) encountered trouble from the State Department and immigration officials. His association with the U.S. Communist Party and identification with anti-imperialist and antiracist organizations throughout the world curtailed his ability to travel overseas. In addition, suspicions of homosexuality could make people, including the nominally closeted Rustin, targets for governmental surveillance and discrimination.',\n",
       " 'Eisenhowers brand of Republicanism angered members of a political movement eventually called the new conservatism. It drew its energy from Republicans who conceded Eisenhowers popularity but questioned his commitment to core GOP principles. Eisenhower appeared to be allowing too many congressional Republicans to cross the aisle and support Democratic-backed spending programs. Arizonas Senator Barry Goldwater emerged as the key political spokesperson for the new conservatism. After he won a second term in the U.S. Senate in 1958, a year when several other prominent GOP conservatives lost, a national magazine hailed him as The Glittering Mr. Goldwater. A slim, ghostwritten book, The Conscience of a Conservative (1960), summarized Goldwaters critique. By refusing to take stronger military measures against the Soviet Union and by not making victory the goal of U.S. policy, Eisenhower was endangering the nations security. Goldwater portrayed most domestic programs, including those supported by Eisenhower, as threats to individual liberty and as steps toward national bankruptcy. The GOP needed a clean break from the Democratic Partys New Deal antics and Ikes dime store New Deal, the senator charged. For economic ideas, the new conservatism looked to Europeans, such as Friedrich von Hayek, and to their American disciples, particularly Milton Friedman. Once a Keynesian, the quick-witted, fast-talking Friedman had later reoriented his economic ideas in a libertarian direction. Governmental action, he argued, generally interfered with self-correcting marketplace forces and thus generated additional pro blems rather than genuine solutions. When government absolutely needed to act, as it should have done more forcefully during the Great Depression, its touch must be as light as possible. Friedmans impressive list of popular and scholarly publications showed that he could write as clearly, and as quickly, as he spoke. Headquartered at the University of Chicago, he helped symbolize a persistent pattern: Economists generally sympathetic to Keynesianism tended to migrate to institutions on either coast, while those embracing more free market approaches generally gravitated toward the heartland. Meanwhile, Friedmans eventual ally, the author-publisher William F. Buckley, Jr., was framing a broad ideological platform for the new conservatism. In God and Man at Yale (1952), the devoutly Roman Catholic Buckley attacked what he saw as a collectivist and anti-religious tilt in higher education. A second book, McCarthy and His Enemies (1954), defended the controversial senator. Then, in 1955, Buckley began his most ambitious enterprise: a new conservative magazine, the National Review. This publication avoided the anti-Semitism of some old-line conservatives and adopted an organizational strategy for the long run. To this end, Buckley joined other conservatives in establishing Young Americans for Free dom (YAF) in 1960, several years before similar college-based political organiza tions emerged on the political left. Buckleys group adopted another long-term approach to building a conserva tive movement, fusionism. The National Review featured a creative tension that fused three broad constituencies: traditionalist conservatives, who insisted that social stability depended on the educated, talented few, such as themselves, domi nating the nations institutions; libertarians, who favored drastically limiting the power of government; and staunch anticommunists who endorsed unleashing U.S. military power against the Soviets. The National Review attracted an eclectic group of writers who collaborated on developing ideas that could shape the new conservatism. Any program for coexis tence with communism, according to the magazines manifesto, was neither desir able nor possible, nor honorable. Excessive bipartisanship was robbing politics of necessary conflict, while Big Brother government and union monopolies were threatening economic freedom. The National Review also sought to cover cul tural affairs from a conservative perspective that made excellence (rather than new ness) and honest intellectual combat (rather than conformity) its watchwords. A zest for cultural combat animated other conservative projects. The writer Ayn Rands fierce brand of secular libertarianism and commitment to sexual exper imentation made her unwelcome at the staid National Review. Her novel Atlas Shrugged (1957), however, confirmed Rands iconic status among libertarians, who endorsed her call for ignoring any public good and for advancing, instead, ones own self-interest. A number of conservative groups spread the religious ideals that Rand ridiculed. The Campus Crusade for Christ urged college students to live according to traditional religious ideals and to preach this message among their peers. Clarence Manion, a prominent Catholic Democrat, developed a forceful con servative presence on the radio dial, The Manion Forum, and helped spearhead an effort to draft Barry Goldwater to run as Eisenhowers successor in 1960. Goldwaters western brand of conservatism spread across the new suburbs of the Sun Belt states. Many suburban conservatives derived their family incomes from high tech jobs in the military-related sector and called for increased federal spending on national defense. On domestic issues, however, these suburban warriors championed a vision of more limited government and denounced outside authorities, both state and national, for infringing on the liberty and power of their local communities.',\n",
       " 'Meanwhile, greater numbers of women were working outside the house. Female employment, even among married women, rose steadily as jobs expanded in the clerical and service sectors. In 1948, about 25 percent of married mothers worked outside the home; at the end of the 1950s, nearly 40 percent did. With the 1960 introduction of a new method of oral contraception, the birth control pill, women could exercise greater control over family planning and career decisionsand over decisions about their own sexual behavior. By 1964, one-quarter of the couples that used contraception relied on The Pill. At the same time, activists began to press for an end to state antiabortion laws that restricted the ability of women to find legal and relatively safe ways to terminate pregnancies. Employment opportunities still remained circumscribed. Virtually all of the nations nurses, telephone operators, secretaries, and elementary school teachers were women. Historically, pay scales in these areas lagged behind those for men in occupations that required comparable training. Jobs for women in the unionized job sectors remained rare. And chances for advancement in the corporate field were similarly limited. As the number of low-paying jobs for women expanded during the 1950s, better paying professional opportunities actually narrowed. Medical, law, and other professional schools admitted lower percentages of women than in the past. When Sandra Day (who would later become U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day OConnor) graduated with honors from a prestigious law school during the 1950s, not a single private firm offered her a job. She worked, without pay, in the public sector. The number of women on college faculties shrank even from the low levels of earlier decades. Although employers still invoked the family wage ideal to justify higher pay for men, more women than ever before were trying to support a family on their own paychecks. This was especially true for women of color. Recognizing that images of domesticity hardly fit the lives of many African American women, Ebony magazine celebrated black women who combined success in parenting and at work. Mass-circulation magazines aimed at women of European descent also carried increasingly mixed messages about gender roles. Although social commentators commonly labeled a womans pursuit of activities outside the home as unnatural, popular magazines increasingly featured stories about women in public life and in business. The 1950s, in short, saw growing diversity in both the social roles that women were assuming and the ways in which mass culture represented them.',\n",
       " 'On November 22, 1963, the president was shot dead as his presidential motorcade moved through Dallas, Texas. Vice President Lyndon Johnson, who had accompanied Kennedy to Texas, took the oath of office and rushed back to Washington. Equally quickly, the Dallas police arrested Lee Harvey Oswald and pegged him as JFKs assassin. Oswald had vague ties to organized crime; had once lived in the Soviet Union; and had a bizarre set of political affiliations, including shadowy ones with groups interested in Cuba. He declared his innocence but never faced trial. Jack Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner, killed Oswald on national television, while the alleged gunman was in police custody. An investigation by a special commission headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren con cluded that both Oswald and Ruby had acted alone. Kennedys life and presidency remain topics of historical debate and tabloid style speculation. His assassination still provokes conspiracy theories and controversies. Researchers have provided new details about his poor health, reliance on exotic medications, and dalliances with womenall of which were kept from the public at the time. Historians continue to debate what JFK might have done in Vietnam and on the domestic front had he won the 1964 presidential election.']"

Overriding the doubts of key advisers, Kennedy approved this Eisenhower-era plan.

Unknown to the Kennedy administration in 1962, the Soviets had already placed tactical nuclear weapons, which could have reached U.S. targets, inside Cuba.'"
