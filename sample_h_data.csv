"The first misstep of the Kennedy presidency, an ill-conceived
1961 CIA mission against Cuba, also had its roots in the
Eisenhower administration. The CIA had been secretly planning an invasion to
oust Fidel Castro. Overriding the doubts of key advisers, Kennedy approved this
Eisenhower-era plan. On April 17, 1961, however, when U.S.-trained forces mainly anticommunist Cuban exiles) landed at the Bahia de Cochinas (Bay of Pigs)
on the southern coast of Cuba, the expected popular uprising against Castro failed
to materialize. Instead, forces loyal to the Cuban revolution quickly surrounded and
captured members of the mission. Kennedy rejected any additional steps, including
the air strikes that the Cuban exiles had expected, and initially denied any U.S.
involvement in this Bay of Pigs invasion. The CIA’s role quickly became public
knowledge, however, and anti-U.S. sentiment swept across Latin America. Castro
tightened his grip over Cuban life and strengthened his ties to the Soviet Union.
Kennedy responded by calling the Bay of Pigs invasion a mistake—and by
devising a new, covert program called “Operation Mongoose.” It abandoned the
idea of an invasion in favor of destabilizing Cuba’s economy and, in concert with
organized crime figures, trying to assassinate the Cuban leader.
Tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union increased as well. In
June 1961, Nikita Khrushchev and Kennedy met in Vienna, Austria, where the
Soviets proposed ending the Western presence in Berlin and reuniting the city as
part of East Germany. Kennedy refused to abandon West Berlin, but in August
1961 the communist regime began to erect a barbed wire fence and then a concrete
barrier to separate East from West Berlin. This Berlin Wall became a symbol of
communist repression. Kennedy’s assertion in a 1963 speech, “Ich bin ein Berliner
(I am a Berliner),” delivered in front of the wall to a cheering crowd of West
Berliners, provided a memorable image of JFK’s presidency.
Superpower confrontation, however, had already escalated to a potentially
lethal level during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. The Soviet Union,
responding to pleas from Castro, sent sophisticated armaments to Cuba. After U-2
spy planes revealed missile-launching sites in Cuba, the Kennedy administration
declared it would never allow the Soviet Union to place nuclear warheads so
close to U.S. soil. It demanded that the Soviets dismantle the missile silos and
turn back supply ships heading for Cuba. After tense strategizing sessions with
his top advisers, Kennedy rejected a military strike against Cuba, fearing it might
lead to war with the Soviet Union. Instead, he ordered the navy to “quarantine”
Cuba. The Strategic Air Command went on full alert for a possible nuclear con flict. Both sides also began frantic, secret diplomatic maneuvers to forestall such a
catastrophe.
The showdown ended after 13 anxious days. On October 28, 1962,
Khrushchev ordered the Soviet missiles in Cuba dismantled and the supply ships
brought home; Kennedy promised not to invade Cuba and secretly assured
Khrushchev that he would complete a previously planned withdrawal of U.S. mis siles from Turkey. When Soviet archives were opened in the mid-1990s, people
learned that the Cuban Missile Crisis had been even more dangerous than earlier
imagined. Unknown to the Kennedy administration in 1962, the Soviets had
already placed tactical nuclear weapons, which could have reached U.S. targets,
inside Cuba. Some historical evidence suggests Castro favored atomic conflict over
diplomatic concessions.
The Cuban Missile Crisis underscored the peril of nuclear conflict and made
the two superpowers more cautious. To prevent a future confrontation or an
accident, they established a direct telephone hot-line between Moscow and
Washington, D.C.",Kennedy presidency's wrong actions
"The politics of anticommunism came to affect the U.S. labor
movement. After the end of the Second World War, many
workers struck for increased wages and benefits and for a
greater voice in workplace routines and production decisions.
Strikes brought both the auto and the electronics industries
to a standstill. After President Truman threatened to seize mines and railroads that
had been shut down by work stoppages and to order strikers back to work, labor
militancy began to subside. In 1947, a Republican-controlled Congress tapped anticommunist sentiment to help pass the Labor-Management Relations Act, popularly known as the Taft Hartley Act. The law negated gains made by organized labor during the 1930s. It limited a union’s power to conduct boycotts, to compel employers to accept
“closed shops” in which only union members could be hired, and to continue a
strike that the president judged harmful to national security. In addition, the mea sure required union officials to pledge that they did not belong to the Communist
Party or any other “subversive” organization. A union that refused to comply was
denied protections under national labor laws. Congress overrode Truman’s veto of
Taft-Hartley, and by the end of his presidency a loyalty-security check had been
conducted on about 20 percent of the U.S. workforce, more than 13 million people.
The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) expelled 13 unions—a full third of
its membership—as anticommunism also influenced internal labor politics. Many
workers found that their political commitments could put their own jobs at risk. Anticommunists scrutinized workers in the entertainment indus try with special zeal. In 1947, the House Un-American Activi ties Committee (HUAC) opened hearings into communist
influences in Hollywood. Basking in the glare of newsreel cam eras, members of this committee seized on the refusal of ten screenwriters, producers, and directors—all current or former members of the American Communist Party—to
testify about political allegiances within the film community. “The Hollywood Ten”
claimed that the First Amendment barred HUAC from scrutinizing their political activ ities. The federal courts upheld HUAC’s investigative powers, however, and the Holly wood Ten eventually went to prison for contempt of Congress.
Hollywood studios as well as radio and television networks enforced their own
internal “blacklists” of workers, allegedly subversives, whom they agreed not to hire.
Blacklists affected not only prominent performers but many anonymous labor union
members who worked behind the scenes in technical and support positions. Many
entertainment workers were unable to find jobs unless they agreed to become
“friendly witnesses” before HUAC or other investigative committees and to provide
the names of people they had seen at some “communist meeting” in the past. Some
of those called to testify, such as the screenwriter Lillian Hellman, refused to answer
any questions. Others, such as the movie director Elia Kazan and the writer Budd
Schulberg, cooperated. Decisions over whether or not to “name names” would divide
people in the entertainment industry and the labor union movement for decades.
The search for subversives created anticommunist celebrities. Ronald Reagan, presi dent of the Screen Actors Guild and a secret informant for the FBI (identified as “T-10”),
testified about communist influence in Hollywood. Richard Nixon, an obscure member
of Congress from California, began his political ascent in 1948 when Whittaker Cham bers, a journalist formerly active in communist circles, came before HUAC. Chambers
charged Alger Hiss, a prominent Democrat, with having been a party member and
with passing classified information to Soviet agents during the late 1930s.
The Hiss–Chambers–Nixon affair still sparks controversy. Legal considerations
barred an indictment of Hiss for espionage, but the government charged him with per jury for allegedly lying to Congress. Ultimately convicted on two counts, Hiss spent
nearly four years in prison. To Nixon and his supporters, the case of Alger Hiss, who
had advised Franklin Roosevelt during the Yalta Conference, demonstrated how deeply
rooted communist subversion had become. To his supporters, Hiss appeared the victim
of a frame-up. In the mid-1990s, newly declassified documents revived the Hiss contro versy. A few scholars continued to defend Hiss. The vast majority, however, concluded
that Hiss (along with several other high-ranking government officials) had likely passed
information to the Soviets during the 1930s and 1940s. Historians continue to differ,
however, over the precise nature of this material and its value to Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Truman administration pursued its own anticommunist course
at home. It dismissed hundreds of federal employees under its loyalty program.
Truman’s attorney general, Tom Clark, secretly authorized J. Edgar Hoover, head
of the FBI, to compile a list of alleged subversives the government could detain
during any national emergency without any legal hearing.
Fear that subversives might immigrate to the United States helped shape several
provisions of the McCarran-Walter Act. Also known as the Immigration and Nation ality Act of 1952, this law authorized denial of immigrant status to anyone who
might compromise national security by bringing dangerous ideas into the country. It
also allowed the deportation of immigrants, even naturalized citizens, who belonged
to organizations on the Attorney General’s List. Calling these measures “un American,” Truman rejected McCarran-Walter, but Congress overrode his veto.
Hoover’s FBI also undertook an extensive campaign of surveillance. It compiled
confidential dossiers on artists and intellectuals suspected of radical views. Some of its targets, including the writers Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck, had
no links to the Communist Party. The FBI often singled out prominent African
Americans, including civil rights activist Bayard Rustin, Richard Wright (author of
the acclaimed novel Native Son), and W. E. B. Du Bois (a celebrated African
American historian). Paul Robeson (a well-known entertainer-activist) encountered
trouble from the State Department and immigration officials. His association with
the U.S. Communist Party and identification with anti-imperialist and antiracist
organizations throughout the world curtailed his ability to travel overseas. In
addition, suspicions of homosexuality could make people, including the nominally
closeted Rustin, targets for governmental surveillance and discrimination.","Anticommunism
and the U.S.

"Eisenhower’s brand of Republicanism angered members of a
political movement eventually called the “new conservatism.”
It drew its energy from Republicans who conceded Eisenhower’s
popularity but questioned his commitment to core GOP principles. Eisenhower
appeared to be allowing too many congressional Republicans to cross the aisle and
support Democratic-backed spending programs. Arizona’s Senator Barry Goldwater emerged as the key political spokesperson
for the new conservatism. After he won a second term in the U.S. Senate in 1958,
a year when several other prominent GOP conservatives lost, a national magazine
hailed him as “The Glittering Mr. Goldwater.” A slim, ghostwritten book, The
Conscience of a Conservative (1960), summarized Goldwater’s critique. By refusing
to take stronger military measures against the Soviet Union and by not making
“victory the goal” of U.S. policy, Eisenhower was endangering the nation’s security. Goldwater portrayed most domestic programs, including those supported by
Eisenhower, as threats to individual liberty and as steps toward national
bankruptcy. The GOP needed a clean break from the Democratic Party’s “New
Deal antics” and Ike’s “dime store New Deal,” the senator charged.
For economic ideas, the new conservatism looked to Europeans, such as
Friedrich von Hayek, and to their American disciples, particularly Milton Friedman.
Once a Keynesian, the quick-witted, fast-talking Friedman had later reoriented his
economic ideas in a libertarian direction. Governmental action, he argued, generally
interfered with self-correcting marketplace forces and thus generated additional pro blems rather than genuine solutions. When government absolutely needed to act, as it
should have done more forcefully during the Great Depression, its touch must be as
light as possible. Friedman’s impressive list of popular and scholarly publications
showed that he could write as clearly, and as quickly, as he spoke. Headquartered
at the University of Chicago, he helped symbolize a persistent pattern: Economists
generally sympathetic to Keynesianism tended to migrate to institutions on either
coast, while those embracing more free market approaches generally gravitated
toward the heartland.
Meanwhile, Friedman’s eventual ally, the author-publisher William F. Buckley,
Jr., was framing a broad ideological platform for the new conservatism. In God and
Man at Yale (1952), the devoutly Roman Catholic Buckley attacked what he saw as
a “collectivist” and anti-religious tilt in higher education. A second book,
McCarthy and His Enemies (1954), defended the controversial senator. Then, in
1955, Buckley began his most ambitious enterprise: a new conservative magazine,
the National Review. This publication avoided the anti-Semitism of some old-line
conservatives and adopted an organizational strategy for the long run. To this
end, Buckley joined other conservatives in establishing Young Americans for Free dom (YAF) in 1960, several years before similar college-based political organiza tions emerged on the political left. Buckley’s group adopted another long-term approach to building a conserva tive movement, “fusionism.” The National Review featured a creative tension that
fused three broad constituencies: “traditionalist” conservatives, who insisted that
social stability depended on the educated, talented few, such as themselves, domi nating the nation’s institutions; “libertarians,” who favored drastically limiting the
power of government; and staunch anticommunists who endorsed unleashing U.S.
military power against the Soviets.
The National Review attracted an eclectic group of writers who collaborated on
developing ideas that could shape the new conservatism. Any program for coexis tence with communism, according to the magazine’s manifesto, was “neither desir able nor possible, nor honorable.” Excessive “bipartisanship” was robbing politics
of necessary conflict, while “Big Brother government” and “union monopolies”
were threatening economic freedom. The National Review also sought to cover cul tural affairs from a conservative perspective that made “excellence (rather than ‘new ness’)” and “honest intellectual combat (rather than conformity)” its watchwords.
A zest for cultural combat animated other conservative projects. The writer
Ayn Rand’s fierce brand of secular libertarianism and commitment to sexual exper imentation made her unwelcome at the staid National Review. Her novel Atlas
Shrugged (1957), however, confirmed Rand’s iconic status among libertarians, who endorsed her call for ignoring any “public good” and for advancing, instead,
one’s own self-interest. A number of conservative groups spread the religious ideals
that Rand ridiculed. The Campus Crusade for Christ urged college students to live
according to traditional religious ideals and to preach this message among their
peers. Clarence Manion, a prominent Catholic Democrat, developed a forceful con servative presence on the radio dial, The Manion Forum, and helped spearhead an
effort to draft Barry Goldwater to run as Eisenhower’s successor in 1960.
Goldwater’s western brand of conservatism spread across the new suburbs of the
Sun Belt states. Many suburban conservatives derived their family incomes from high tech jobs in the military-related sector and called for increased federal spending on
national defense. On domestic issues, however, these “suburban warriors” championed
a vision of more limited government and denounced “outside” authorities, both state
and national, for infringing on the liberty and power of their local communities.","The New
Conservatism"
"Meanwhile, greater numbers of women were working outside
the house. Female employment, even among married women,
rose steadily as jobs expanded in the clerical and service sectors. In 1948, about 25 percent of married mothers worked
outside the home; at the end of the 1950s, nearly 40 percent did. With the 1960
introduction of a new method of oral contraception, the birth control pill, women
could exercise greater control over family planning and career decisions—and over
decisions about their own sexual behavior. By 1964, one-quarter of the couples that
used contraception relied on “The Pill.” At the same time, activists began to press
for an end to state antiabortion laws that restricted the ability of women to find
legal and relatively safe ways to terminate pregnancies. Employment opportunities still remained circumscribed. Virtually all of the
nation’s nurses, telephone operators, secretaries, and elementary school teachers were
women. Historically, pay scales in these areas lagged behind those for men in occupations that required comparable training. Jobs for women in the unionized job sectors
remained rare. And chances for advancement in the corporate field were similarly limited. As the number of low-paying jobs for women expanded during the 1950s, better paying professional opportunities actually narrowed. Medical, law, and other professional schools admitted lower percentages of women than in the past. When Sandra
Day (who would later become U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor)
graduated with honors from a prestigious law school during the 1950s, not a single private firm offered her a job. She worked, without pay, in the public sector. The number
of women on college faculties shrank even from the low levels of earlier decades. Although employers still invoked the “family wage” ideal to justify higher pay
for men, more women than ever before were trying to support a family on their own paychecks. This was especially true for women of color. Recognizing that
images of domesticity hardly fit the lives of many African American women,
Ebony magazine celebrated black women who combined success in parenting and
at work. Mass-circulation magazines aimed at women of European descent also carried
increasingly mixed messages about gender roles. Although social commentators
commonly labeled a woman’s pursuit of activities outside the home as “unnatural,”
popular magazines increasingly featured stories about women in public life and in
business. The 1950s, in short, saw growing diversity in both the social roles that
women were assuming and the ways in which mass culture represented them.","Signs of

"On November 22, 1963, the president was shot dead as his
presidential motorcade moved through Dallas, Texas. Vice
President Lyndon Johnson, who had accompanied Kennedy
to Texas, took the oath of office and rushed back to
Washington. Equally quickly, the Dallas police arrested Lee
Harvey Oswald and pegged him as JFK’s assassin. Oswald had vague ties to organized crime; had once lived in the Soviet Union; and had a bizarre set of political
affiliations, including shadowy ones with groups interested in Cuba. He declared
his innocence but never faced trial. Jack Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner, killed
Oswald on national television, while the alleged gunman was in police custody.
An investigation by a special commission headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren con cluded that both Oswald and Ruby had acted alone.
Kennedy’s life and presidency remain topics of historical debate and tabloid style speculation. His assassination still provokes conspiracy theories and controversies. Researchers have provided new details about his poor health, reliance on
exotic medications, and dalliances with women—all of which were kept from
the public at the time. Historians continue to debate what JFK might have done in
Vietnam and on the domestic front had he won the 1964 presidential election.","The
